THE Airbnb CLONE.
=================


The Airbnb clone is the first step building a fully functional application or website.
The clone deals with testing a program using in the Command Line Interface using a builtin python cmd module

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

How to start project:
In order to start the console, use the following command: ./console.py

How to use project:
manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interprete
store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
Commands: create, show, destroy, all (shows all), update, help, quit
Example how to open:
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
